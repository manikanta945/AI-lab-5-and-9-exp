Exp 5: Water-Jug problem
Aim: Write a Program to Implement the Water-Jug problem using Python.
Water Jug Problem
The Water Jug Problem is a classic AI problem where you are given two jugs of different
capacities and need to measure a specific amount of water using them.
Problem Statement
• You have two jugs with capacities X liters and Y liters.
• Your goal is to measure exactly Z liters using the jugs.
• Allowed Operations:
o Fill a jug.
o Empty a jug.
o Pour water from one jug to another until one is full or the other is empty.
Algorithm:
1. Create a queue to store the state of jugs (x, y).
2. Create a set to store visited states to avoid repetition.
3. Enqueue the initial state (0, 0) and mark it as visited.
4. While the queue is not empty:
• Dequeue the current state (a, b).
• If a == Z or b == Z, print the steps and return success.
• Generate the next possible states by:
o Filling jug X
o Filling jug Y
o Emptying jug X
o Emptying jug Y
o Pouring from X to Y
o Pouring from Y to X
• If the new state is not visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
5. If no solution is found, return failure.
